# MKDemo React Native App

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Welcome to the **MKDemo React Native App**! This is a demo application built to demonstrate a sample project using React Native. It showcases core functionalities, navigation, and UI components while maintaining modern development standards.

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

## âœ… Requirements
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS development)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start Metro
Metro is the JavaScript build tool for React Native. To start the Metro dev server, run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Build and Run Your App
With Metro running, open a new terminal and use one of the following commands:

#### Android
```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### iOS
For iOS, install CocoaPods dependencies (only required on first setup or when updating native dependencies):

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```
Then, run:

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the emulator or a connected device.

### Step 3: Modify Your App
Open `App.tsx` in your text editor and make changes. Thanks to [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh), your app will update automatically.

To manually reload:
- **Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice or select **Reload** from the **Dev Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator.

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!
You've successfully run and modified your React Native app! ðŸš€
